# Smart App project integration repo

This repository is meant to develop the complete integration for the smart application project. 

In order to make changes to the single submodules, you will need to run:
- `git checkout main`

before making your changes. 
After pushing your changes to the submodule repository, running the update.sh script is needed to update the commit references to the latest in each submodule and to reflect changes in the repository.
