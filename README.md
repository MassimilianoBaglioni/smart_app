## To run 
In order to execute the project, docker is required. 

To run the project execute: 
- docker-compose build
- docker-compose up

To make local changes and testing, you will need to either create a virtual environment or install the required libraries specified in each folder, inside the requirements.txt file. 

To create an evnvironment, navigate to the desired container folder and run: 
- python -m venv venv
- pip install -r requirements.txt

The above two commands will create the local env and install the required libraries.
